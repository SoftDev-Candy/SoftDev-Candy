###Hi, I'm Swastik 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Game Developer with a strong interest in creating immersive and interactive experiences. My journey in tech has been driven by a love for problem-solving, creativity, and the pursuit of knowledge.

🌱 About Me
I'm particularly fascinated by the intricate world of 3D Mathematics, which plays a crucial role in the games and simulations I create. Unreal Engine has been my go-to tool for game development, where I've started exploring Level Design, Lighting, and custom gameplay mechanics. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual environments.

🛠️ Skills & Experience
I have a growing foundation in various tools and technologies:

Unreal Engine: Basic knowledge in game development and level design; actively learning more about its powerful features.
C++: Proficient in programming, particularly in game development contexts.
Version Control: Experience with Git and other version control systems for managing and collaborating on code.
Python: Basic familiarity for scripting, automation, and tool development.
3D Mathematics: Solid understanding of the mathematical concepts that underpin 3D graphics and game physics.
I'm working on improving these skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning, and I’m excited to see where they’ll take me in the future.

🎮 Current Projects
I'm constantly working on new projects that challenge my skills and allow me to learn and grow as a developer. Whether it's a new game prototype, a software tool, or a complex algorithm, I strive to make each project a reflection of my passion and dedication. You can explore my ongoing and completed projects right here on my GitHub.
