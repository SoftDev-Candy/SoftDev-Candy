## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi, I'm Swastik ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Game Developer with a strong interest in creating immersive and interactive experiences. My journey in tech has been driven by a love for problem-solving, creativity, and the pursuit of knowledge.

ðŸŒ± About Me
I'm particularly fascinated by the intricate world of 3D Mathematics, which plays a crucial role in the games and simulations I create. Unreal Engine has been my go-to tool for game development, where I've delved deep into Level Design, Lighting, and custom mechanics. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in virtual environments.

ðŸŽ® Current Projects
I'm constantly working on new projects that challenge my skills and allow me to learn and grow as a developer. Whether it's a new game prototype, a software tool, or a complex algorithm, I strive to make each project a reflection of my passion and dedication. You can explore my ongoing and completed projects right here on my GitHub.
